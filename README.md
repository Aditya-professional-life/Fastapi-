# Roadmap


Day-Wise Roadmap to Master FastAPI and REST API Development

Week 1: FastAPI Basics and Fundamentals

Day 1: Introduction to FastAPI, installation, and project setup. Create your first API.

Day 2: Understanding path and query parameters; working with Pydantic models for request validation.

Day 3: Handling request bodies, custom responses, status codes, headers, and cookies.

Day 4: Error handling with HTTPException, creating custom error handlers.

Day 5: Dependency Injection: creating reusable dependencies.

Day 6: Building a simple CRUD application to reinforce routing, models, and error handling.

Day 7: Review and add more advanced features like validation and error handling to your CRUD app.


Week 2: Intermediate FastAPI Features and Database Integration

Day 8: Middleware: creating custom middleware for logging, security, and request/response modifications.

Day 9: Background tasks: setting up async background tasks for non-blocking operations.

Day 10: Authentication: Implement OAuth2, password flow, bearer tokens, and setting up security features.

Day 11: JWT Authentication: securing APIs with JWT tokens for user authentication.

Day 12: Database Integration: Setting up SQLAlchemy with FastAPI for SQL databases (PostgreSQL/MySQL).

Day 13: Async database operations for better performance using Tortoise ORM or databases package.

Day 14: Build a small project that integrates authentication, async operations, and database models.


Week 3: Advanced FastAPI, REST Principles, and Testing

Day 15: Advanced request validation with Pydantic, handling complex nested JSON.

Day 16: RESTful API principles: idempotency, statelessness, pagination, and versioning best practices.

Day 17: Performance optimization: using async endpoints, caching strategies, and response optimization.

Day 18: Implement microservices communication using REST and explore gRPC basics for service-to-service communication.

Day 19: Testing FastAPI: writing unit tests and integration tests with PyTest, using TestClient.

Day 20: Error management best practices: creating custom error responses and logging strategies.

Day 21: Midpoint review: integrate all learned features into a robust microservice with CRUD, authentication, and error handling.


Week 4: Deployment, Security, and API Documentation

Day 22: Auto-generated API documentation with Swagger UI and ReDoc; customize OpenAPI schema.

Day 23: Advanced API documentation techniques: adding descriptions, examples, and tags.

Day 24: Containerization with Docker: Create Dockerfiles, build images, and run FastAPI apps in containers.

Day 25: Setting up CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins or GitHub Actions for automated deployment.

Day 26: Cloud deployment: deploy FastAPI applications on AWS/GCP/Azure; scaling microservices.

Day 27: Security best practices: implementing CORS, securing sensitive data, protecting against XSS and SQL Injection.

Day 28: Implement rate limiting and throttling to protect APIs from abuse.

Day 29: Capstone project: build a fully-featured microservice integrating all concepts (authentication, async, deployment, etc.).

Day 30: Final project deployment, code review, optimization, and reflection on learning journey.


Post Roadmap:

Ongoing Practice: Contribute to open-source projects, work on real-world microservices, and keep refining your FastAPI skills.

Resources: Regularly update your knowledge with FastAPI documentation, participate in communities, and stay current with new features.


This roadmap combines the fundamentals of FastAPI with advanced REST API development principles, tailored to help you build and deploy robust microservices efficiently. Let me know if you need further adjustments or deep dives into any specific topic!
